A set of libraries useful for building a UK energy comparison website.

Read about DNO's here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_network_operator

Included is a mapping for UK Postcode district to DNO Location, A DNO Location to GSP mapping and a libray to get the postcode district from a full UK postcode. These libraries can be used when building a UK energy comparison website as most tariffs are related to their DNO location or GSP code. Energy prices and standing order charges for Gas & electricity vary by these. When building our green energy comparison website I found it very difficult to get a list of postcode districts to DNO locations. Check out https://www.greenmybeans.com for domestic and business green energy comparison.
